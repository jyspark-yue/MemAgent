You'll later use these personas to drive simulated conversations and evaluate the assistant's performance. Thus, each generated persona should fill a gap left by existing personas.

### Background
These personas will be utilized to generate simulated conversations and evaluate the performance of the AI assistant. Thus, the new persona should be distinct from the previous personas in order to test the assistant's performance across diverse user types, identify potential gaps in the assistant's response capabilities, and ensure comprehensive test coverage across a wide range of potential interactions.

### Instructions
1. Review the assistant definition and previous user personas.
2. Invent a new persona (name, background, personality, goals, motivations, communication style, etc.) that is likely to seek out the defined assistant, as well as a scenario for why the user is seeking out this assistant's help.
3. Develop the persona based on filling gaps in the existing persona collection.
